# OpenVTI 2
----------------------------
The OpenVTI project implements a GPS based video time inserter for overlaying an accurate time stamp on each field of an analog video signal.  The OpenVTI device is an Arduino Mega 2560 single board computer along with a GPS receiver and a video overlay board.  This repository holds the Arduino source code.

## Building the OpenVTI software
---------------------------------
Prerequisites:
- Arduino IDE


## Building the OpenVTI hardware
------------------
The hardware:
- Arduino Mega 2560
- Gowoops GPS Module U-blox NEO-6M(Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Gowoops-Module-Antenna-Arduino-Microcomputer/dp/B01MRNN3YZ)
- TinySine Video Overlay Shield using Max-7456

The source file pinconfig.h explains how to connect the GPS module and the TinySine board.
